# Insert symbol
## Summary
This is an extension to the rich text editor in **AdminApp** that allows the user to insert a special character picked from a predefined list. The list is replaceable and could be modified to the needs of the user.

## Interactions
The popup with the symbol list dropdown popup is opened via a custom button from the editor's toolbar.
- click: inserts the symbol
- symbol hover: displays a tooltip with the defined name of the symbol

## Symbol list source
The symbols that populate the list are defined in a JSON file that is imported by the extension. The file is generated by a script making use of the https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref. There are two supplied files for the the symbol list: _symbol-list.json_ and _symbol-list-full.json_. The extension currently uses the _symbol-list.json_ which contains a subset of the fill symbol list.

## Implementation
A **ToolBuilder** class is added in _../utils/tool-builder.ts_ that provides an endpoint for creating and registering a popup tool for the Kendo editor toolbar.

The tool is created and registered in the toolbar and its popup is populated via the **InsertSymbolGenerator** class. Events are attached on InsertSymbolTool._activate() and detached on InsertSymbolTool._close(). On click the _exec() function is called, the symbol is inserted and the popup is closed.

- **SymbolListComponent**: a custom component for the symbol table that handles user interactions and emits the chosen symbols.
- **InsertSymbolProvider**: custom provider that is responsible for registering the tool. The tool itself is responsible for inserting the symbol into the editor.
