# Extending sections menu functionality in AdminApp

The sections menu is a scrollspy located on the top left side of the screen when editing or creating a content item (the sections menu can bee seen in an Event item). By default sections menu is visible only when there are 5 or more field sections. This number can be changed by providing a simple configuration. In order to do so you need to navigate to **Administration -> Settings -> Backend interface**.

Simply navigate to the **Item editing** section and write a number in the **Minimum items to display sections menu** field.

> **Important notes**:
> * If you don't provide a value, the default value `5`, will be used.
