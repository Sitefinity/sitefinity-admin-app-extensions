# Fields change service

The field change service allows you to modify a field when another field is updated. Using this mechanism you can create a binding between 2 (or more) fields and change their values, settings, visibility, etc. when one of them is updated.

In order to achieve the described behavior a custom implementation of the [**FieldChangeService**](http://admin-app-extensions-docs.sitefinity.site/interfaces/fieldchangeservice.html) interface must be provided. 

Its method [**canProcess()**](http://admin-app-extensions-docs.sitefinity.site/interfaces/fieldchangeservice.html#canprocess) is used to determine whether the service should process field changes based on the content type name. This is useful when several content types has fields with the same name, but you want to process changes only for a specific type. In the sample provided the service only handles changes for the newsitems content type.

The [**processChange()**](http://admin-app-extensions-docs.sitefinity.site/interfaces/fieldchangeservice.html#processchange) method is where the main logic takes place. Its is called every time a field is being updated. The method accepts 3 parameters - the name of the changed field, the new value of the field and an array of [**FieldWrapper**](http://admin-app-extensions-docs.sitefinity.site/interfaces/fieldwrapper.html) that contains all fields. The [**FieldWrapper**](http://admin-app-extensions-docs.sitefinity.site/interfaces/fieldwrapper.html) contains a [**FieldModel**](http://admin-app-extensions-docs.sitefinity.site/interfaces/fieldmodel.html) property, which contains information about the [**key**](http://admin-app-extensions-docs.sitefinity.site/interfaces/fieldmodel.html#key) of the field and its [**settigns**](http://admin-app-extensions-docs.sitefinity.site/interfaces/fieldmodel.html#settings). Usually using the key property you can find the field that you want to change and then update either its [**settigns**](http://admin-app-extensions-docs.sitefinity.site/interfaces/fieldmodel.html#settings) or its value (using the [**writeValue()**](http://admin-app-extensions-docs.sitefinity.site/interfaces/fieldwrapper.html#writevalue) method).
