# Extending sections menu functionality in AdminApp

The sections menu is a scrollspy located on the top left side of the screen when editing or creating a content item (the sections menu can bee seen in an Event item). By default sections menu is visible only when there are 5 or more field sections. This number can be changed by providing a simple configuration. Learn how to configure it [here](https://www.progress.com/documentation/sitefinity-cms/backend-interface-settings).
