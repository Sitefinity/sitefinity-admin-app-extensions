# Extending search functionality in AdminApp

***Disclaimer: The search extensibility works for list view, related data fields and media selectors. Searching in parent selectors for Libraries and Pages cannot be currently modified.***

By default the search functionality only searches the items' titles. You can extend which other fields are to be used when searching. Learn how to configure it [here](https://www.progress.com/documentation/sitefinity-cms/backend-interface-settings).
